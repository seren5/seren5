## 👋 Hi there, I'm Shuyue (Emily) Ren!

I'm a Junior at Barnard College majoring in CS, I'm interested in data, machine learning, and am passionate about solving real world problems!

## 🔍 About Me

I first realized my interest in the field of AI and data science when I was younger, discovering the intriguing patterns in the environment around me, starting with the pavement, and growing through language (French, Portuguese, Japanese, and now Spanish).

I thrive at the intersection of data, impact, and innovation, leading me to participate in Break Through Tech AI as a Fellow, and expanding my technical toolkit through hands-on ML projects. In the fall of 2025, I worked with members of my BTTAI team with mentors from Snowflake to identify transportation deserts in Brooklyn, using a model to predict how surges in population growth would impact each neighborhood.

I am always seeking opportunities to build, learn, and collaborate with people from different walks of life on real-world tech challenges that can make a change.

Let’s connect! I'm always open to internships, research projects, or tech convos!

## 📚 What I'm Learning/Working On

In addition to Break Through Tech, I'm working on creating a productivity app implementing features I personally find helpful that I currently do not see on the market. I am also reading up on the connection between linguistics and AI, so feel free to reach out to talk about it!

For my courses, I've taken Object Oriented Programming, Data Structures, Computer Networks, Microprocessors and Assembly Language, and Theory of Computation. I am currently taking classes on LLMs and Ethics, AI, Advanced Programming, and Fundamentals of Computer Systems.

## ✨ Fun Fact

I've lived abroad my whole life, so I speak English, French, Mandarin, a little Japanese, and can understand some Portuguese. I am also currently taking Spanish! I volunteered in the 2024 Paris Olympics for golf's mixed media, and got to meet a lot of people from around the world. I played golf competitions while I lived in France, ranking top 200 in 2020 at my best. In the future, I'd like to learn Luxembourgish and German, as I currently reside in Luxembourg.
