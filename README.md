## 📚 What I'm Learning/Working On

In addition to Break Through Tech, I'm working on implementing an app or browser (to be determined) to help with deciding outfits in the morning. I am also reading up on the connection between linguistics and AI, so feel free to reach out to talk about it!

## ✨ Fun Fact

I've lived abroad my whole life, so I speak English, French, Mandarin, a little Japanese, and can understand some Portuguese. I volunteered in the 2024 Paris Olympics for golf's mixed media, and got to meet a lot of people from around the world. I played golf competitions while I lived in France, ranking top 200 in 2020 at my best.
